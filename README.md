# Garry's Bhop

Garry's Bhop was a Garry's Mod Bunnyhop server ran by me (via NFOservers) that aimed to provide the best experience for bhoppers possible. It fully lived from September 19, 2019 to February 26, 2020.

It started as a pipe dream back in 2014, when I first met FiBzY and Matt0722 back on I think Prestige Gaming. \[pG\] was a pretty popular bunnyhop server at the time, regularly getting 24-30 players, and was a good place for competition. I remember watching in awe as SomebodyEpic and bLand (and probably some others whose names I can't remember anymore) would set record after record, all while shooting the shit and having fun. I wanted so badly to create that environment, but have it to where it was in my control.
