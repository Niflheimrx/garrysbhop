Garry's Bhop was a Garry's Mod Bunnyhop server ran by me (via NFOservers) that aimed to provide the best experience for bhoppers possible. It fully lived from September 19, 2019 to February 26, 2020.

It started as a pipe dream back in 2014, when I first met FiBzY and Matt0722 back on I think Prestige Gaming. \[pG\] was a pretty popular bunnyhop server at the time, regularly getting 24-30 players, and was a good place for competition. I remember watching in awe as SomebodyEpic and bLand (and probably some others whose names I can't remember anymore) would set record after record, all while shooting the shit and having fun. I wanted so badly to create that environment but have it to where it was in my control.

At the time, there was no public gamemode for Garry's Mod Bunnyhop for people to use. [Flow](https://github.com/GMSpeedruns/GM-BunnyHop) didn't release publicly until 2019. At the time, I just happened to be asking around for one and Rel Henwi was there to just drop one in my lap. He ended up giving me george's gamemode. At the time, it was a totally unreleased private gamemode (I don't think it ever released tbh) Henwi had somehow gotten the files of. And he just gave them to me, a total stranger.

I decided to host a server using it just...on my PC. Yeah, IP exposed to everyone. I wasn't that concerned at the time, and I was pretty young and stupid. I would end up later regretting that when George found out that I had the gamemode and was allowing anyone to play on the server. For the record here: I'm 14 years old and don't have any money. There is no FastDL on the server; you'd have to already have the map downloaded (I think it was bhop_kiwi_cwfx in this particular case) to join. He ended up joining, added me on Steam, and told me to take down the server since I was using his private gamemode. I, like a smart person, said "or what?" and he told me he'd DDoS me. I called his bluff, and ended up getting DDoSed for around 5-6 hours. Thankfully my parents weren't home so they weren't suspicious of why the internet wasn't working, but I think eventually at a certain point I caved and agreed to his terms. 



Thanks to Gravious for the base Flow gamemode. Your work helped an entire community of people survive. I hope you're proud of your work.

For better or for worse, you were all here. Thanks for playing.
