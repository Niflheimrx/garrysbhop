Garry's Bhop was a Garry's Mod Bunnyhop server ran by me (via NFOservers) that aimed to provide the best experience for bhoppers possible. It fully lived from September 19, 2019 to February 26, 2020. The FastDL lived from September 19, 2019 to November 23, 2023.

## Backstory
(To the best of my memory anyway) \
Note that I do not intend to try and draw shit to anyone. I am not innocent either. There are things I wish I could go back and fix, but ultimately this is my honest rendition of how the story went and generally how I felt.

It started as a pipe dream back in 2014, when I first met FiBzY and Matt0722 back on I think Prestige Gaming. \[pG\] was a pretty popular bunnyhop server at the time, regularly getting 24-30 players and it was a good place for competition. I remember watching in awe as SomebodyEpic and bLand (and probably some others whose names I can't remember anymore) would set record after record, all while shooting the shit and having fun. I wanted so badly to create that environment but have it to where it was in my control.

At the time, there was no public gamemode for Garry's Mod Bunnyhop for people to use. [Flow](https://github.com/GMSpeedruns/GM-BunnyHop) didn't release publicly until 2019. At the time, I just happened to be asking around for one and Rel Henwi was there to just drop one in my lap. He ended up giving me georgerulesLOL's gamemode. At the time, it was a totally unreleased private gamemode (I don't think it ever released tbh) Henwi had somehow gotten the files of. And he just gave them to me, a total stranger.

I decided to host a server using it just...on my PC. Yeah, IP exposed to everyone. I wasn't that concerned at the time, and I was pretty young and stupid. I would end up later regretting that when George found out that I had the gamemode and was allowing anyone to play on the server. For the record here: I'm 14 years old at this point and don't have any money. There is no FastDL on the server; you'd have to already have the map downloaded (I think it was bhop_kiwi_cwfx in this particular case) to join. He ended up joining, added me on Steam, and told me to take down the server since I was using his private gamemode. I, like a smart person, said "or what?" and he told me he'd DDoS me. I called his bluff and ended up getting DDoSed for around 5-6 hours. Thankfully my parents weren't home so they weren't suspicious of why the internet wasn't working, but I think eventually at a certain point I caved and agreed to his terms.

Regardless, I eventually relaunched the server after I was sure the heat died down and ran with that for a while. I had ElDigato working for me as a developer. He didn't really play Bunnyhop and was extremely mentally ill, but he had a passion for developing for the server, so I let him. Eventually, at some point, I took it down.

_Likely george's gamemode again, rehosted probably on my PC, despite the name. Excuse our crudeness; there's a lot of things I regret about that era._\

After this point, things get fuzzier. I think after this I took a break and played other games. I eventually came back around 2018 ish and started playing on Ruta's World. That ended up being right around the time Ruta's Bunnyhop server died (iirc), and there I happened to meet and befriend lorp and Dusty. They ended up giving me the gamemode for Ruta's World (again iirc; I think it might've been Justa since he did leak the gamemode due to not liking what lorp and Dusty were doing) under the assumption we would develop it further. I sadly don't have the imgur link anymore, but I had a huge image that listed all the plans and things I wanted to happen. I wish I could still find it and post it here. Regardless, we had big plans, and since I had a job, I could throw money at my developers and they would work. They'd do some work pro-bono but most of it was paid.

Work continued and the server went up under the name Garry's Bhop in September 2019. Again. Now hosted on NFO servers so the server would run 24/7. lorp helped me out a lot with that, and it's a large reason of why I know how to do anything with Ubuntu at a command line level. Progress continued and things were great! I had a team of staff that would zone maps, and I did most of the admin work. I had a lot of issues with staff abusing privleges and just generally not nice things happening, but overall it was serviceable. One of the bigger problems is that Henwi and FiBzY started having issues. I'm still not really sure who started it, but it might've been Henwi talking shit while drunk, and then they both just kept getting more mad at each other. I didn't demote Henwi for any of this behavior, so then FiBzY started to not like me. At this point, FiBzY already had his own server called StrafesOnFleek, which did admittedly make me a bit bitter at the time that he didn't want to play on my server, but in hindsight I understand since the players on my server tended to be total dicks.

In the background, justa was currently developing the new version of Kawaiiclan that was supposedly amazing and then best thing ever. I don't think it ever publicly released, but while it was happening, Kawaiiclan itself was getting ignored. Justa did contact me and said he was down to sell his current version of Kawaiiclan (the dev branch) and then actively continue to develop for it while it was on my server. He tried to get me to spit out a price that I would pay for the perfect gamemode instead of giving me a value of what it's worth to him. I had never seen the gamemode, as I wasn't whitelisted on the private test server he had and had only seen few screenshots. He offered it for 220 euros as a starting price (not counting additions or further work), but I saw the red flags and backed out of the deal completely, sticking with what I had.

Back to FiBzY; tensions worsened between him and I over time, and I don't have records of what broke the camel's back, but he ended up removing me on Discord and Steam and told me we weren't friends anymore. At that point, he kinda cut everyone off, even people like sei who really didn't do anything.

At this point, I was getting pretty tired. I was the main person who was zoning maps at this point and putting in late hours dealing with admin bullshit while everyone else kinda coasted along and did whatever they wanted. I had burnt myself out on bunnyhop due to these factors. I didn't balance as well as I should've between playing and working. I started messaging people around the end of February if they wanted to be owner, and the ones I messaged didn't want it. On February 25, 2020, I messaged Henwi asking if he wanted to be owner. I explained that I felt like I wasn't being a good owner since I wasn't active on the server, and that was the last thing I wanted to do to this group of players that I valued. Henwi ended up agreeing and I taught him how to take care of the server and manage it. I would cover the hosting costs (at least temporarily) and he would just have direct access.

On February 27, 2020, it all went to shit. Henwi ended up telling justa about some confidential info that I did not want shared. I specifically asked to keep it a secret, but he told justa anyway. Regardless, he broke my trust, and after that I felt like I couldn't trust him with the server anymore. And after him, I didn't feel like I had anyone who would have the time or dedication to run the server, so I shut it down.

A little while later, I gathered up all the data and gamemode stuff and released it on my now-defunct personal website, which is where it stayed for 3 years until now. Now, it'll be hosted here as a more permanent form of archival. I'm glad I released all of this data publicly, as due to it, rq was able to use it to develop the gamemode further, and a couple of users ended up creating some LAN servers for them to have some fun on.

Looking back, both then and now, the Garry's Mod Bunnyhop community is...filled with fucking troglodytes. The bunnyhop community is just really not worth the trouble. Regardless, I will say that I had a lot of good memories that were drama-free, of just having fun. Thinking of inventive and tricky bonus routes. Trying new shit. Fixing broken maps. Discovering, learning, teaching. So many good things came of it and I know more today because of my experience back then. I wish things went a lot differently, but I can't help but feel glad it happened.
