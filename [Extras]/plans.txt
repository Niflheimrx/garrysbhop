here was the stuff that we planned to do but never got to because of various reasons.

things that a dev needs to do:
high priority
-add segment with bindable cp menu
-remove extreme
-add wait timer to pause/play
-fix player name labels
-restart confirmation
medium priority
-make lj stats be more consistent
-change least played map to do random
-add fullbright command
low priority
-add every jump UNTIL 6th to ssj
-add mouseleft and mouseright to !keys
-if player is afk for >5 minutes, their vote doesn't count towards votes required to rtv. once they come back, their rtv is required. ignore binds to stay unafk. add to current afk module?
-add sync to moon man, cancer, cheater, high grav, etc
-!mywr still broken
